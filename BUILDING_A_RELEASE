I have not been able to get ANT or Maven to automatically make a One-Jar
executable that correctly supports all platforms, so am resorting to a
manual process.

1. Run ANT task one-jar-dist-all-zip
2. Unzip files in release/UniversalGcodeSender-all32.zip
3. Open UniversalGcodeSender-all32.jar in a file browser.
4. Delete files in jar: /lib/*-natives-*
                        /binlib/*
5. Copy folders and their contents from project /lib/natives/* 
   into jar at /binlib/
6. Rename .jar file UniversalGcodeSender.jar

Note: One-Jar does not support ARM, but the root path is searched last,
      so RaspberryPi files can be put in the root /binlib/ directory.
